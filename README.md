# GPOP_Project

Project to simulate an evolving population

The objective of the project is the simulation of a simple population-genetics model to observe
the influence of genetic drift, mutations, selection and population structure on the evolution of
the population. The simulations will be done using a clonal version of the Wright-Fisher
model.
